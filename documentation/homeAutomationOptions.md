# Automation options for others audiences

| System | Best For | Knowledge Needed | 
| --- | ----- | --------- |
| Google, Alexa, Apple Assistants | Major manufacturers are building smart device radios (i.e. Wifi, Zigbee & Matter) into home devices and sometimes even handle requests locally (i.e. Alexa w/ Phillips Hue). They are plug-in-play and constantly getting more robust (i.e. Scenes, Routines, Triggers). Privacy & device cross-compatibility is currently the biggest limiting factor. | Plug in hardware. Configure without coding.  |
| Homey App | Polished (Apple-like) smart home hub. Connects multiple device ecosystems providing more compatibility across devices. More robust automations through GUI or simplified scripting. Downside is the high cost, $400. | Plug in hardware. Configure. Coding optional. |
| Home Assistant | The most supported and significant open source home automation platform. Some devices are plug-in-play but often require configuration that's a bit like coding. Extensive library of plug-ins provides for wide device support. | Hardware setup and low-code. |

This is by no means a comprehensive this but should be a good starting place if custom code is not your cup of tea.
